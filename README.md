# UNO Arena
## What is this?
Have you ever heard of [UCI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Chess_Interface)?  It's the Universal Chess Interface, which allows communication between chess engines and GUIs. It enables games against and between chess engines, like so:

I'm making something similar for UNO.

## Why?

1. Improving my coding skills
2. I want to pit self-made UNO engines against one another.  It's a good computer science/game theory project.

## To Do
- [ ] Finish implementing UNO logic
- [ ] Re-write protocol for sending moves
- [ ] Add networking abilities
